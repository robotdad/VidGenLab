Portrait of a research project supervisor in professional attire - white lab coat over business clothes, laminated security badge clearly visible. They have an authoritative but clinical demeanor, holding a tablet with expedition data and monitoring information. Their expression is focused and detached - maintaining professional distance from human test subjects. The background shows a control room with mirror monitoring stations and data screens. Professional lighting emphasizes their position of clinical authority over the dimensional exploration experiments.
