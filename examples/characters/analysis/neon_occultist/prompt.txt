Here's a detailed description of the image and a corresponding prompt:

**Image Description**

The image is a close-up portrait of a serious-looking Black man, positioned centrally within the frame. He is wearing dark, futuristic-looking sunglasses that obscure his eyes. He has short, neatly groomed hair and light stubble.

He is dressed in a black T-shirt covered by a black leather jacket with a hood. The jacket is detailed with subtle geometric patterns. Bright cyan blue neon lights run along the edges of the jacket, adding a cyberpunk aesthetic. He also wears two delicate gold chain necklaces, each with a small pendant. One pendant is a turquoise-blue square shape, the other is a glowing pink triangle. There is also a small star design tattooed near his left ear, with hints of blue around it.

The lighting is dramatic. There is a cool-toned light illuminating the left side of his face and jacket, contrasting with the warmer tone on the right. The background is a smooth gradient, transitioning from dark at the top to a lighter shade around the subject's mid-section. This helps to isolate the subject and create a sense of depth.

The overall mood is serious, intense, and futuristic. The combination of leather, neon, and geometric shapes creates a distinct cyberpunk vibe.
