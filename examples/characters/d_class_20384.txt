Portrait of D-20384, 34-year-old male D-Class test subject in standard orange jumpsuit with visible ID number. He has a strong physique and weathered features showing stress and resignation from institutional confinement. His expression shows wariness mixed with forced compliance - someone who knows they're expendable but remains cooperative. He holds basic exploration equipment - flashlight, radio, documentation materials. The background is a sterile preparation area with concrete walls and security monitoring equipment. Harsh institutional lighting emphasizes his vulnerable position in the containment system.
