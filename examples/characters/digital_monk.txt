Studio portrait of a young Asian man with a shaved head, wearing a black traditional robe, facing forward, looking down with a serene expression. He wears a brown wooden mala necklace with a rectangular pendant. Soft, focused lighting with a subtle halo effect around his head, fading to a dark brown background. Introspective, tranquil mood. Modern photography style.
